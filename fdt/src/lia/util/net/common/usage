Usage: java -jar fdt.jar [ OPTIONS ]
       java -jar fdt.jar [ OPTIONS ] -c <host> STANDALONE_ARGS
       java -jar fdt.jar [ OPTIONS ] SCP_SYNTAX


STANDALONE_ARGS: [file1 ...]|[-fl <fileList>]
SCP_SYNTAX: [-gsissh] [[user@][host1:]]file1 [[user@][host2:]]file2

Client specific:
   -c <host>		 connect to the specified <host>
   			 If this parameter is missing FDT will become server
   -d <destinationDir>	 The destination directory used to copy the files
   -fl <fileList>	 a list of files (MUST containe one file per line)
   -r			 Recursive. Searches for files in all specified 
   			 directories and subdirectories
   -pull		 Pull Mode.The client will receive the data from
   			 the server
   -ss <windowSize>	 Set TCP SO_SND_BUFFER window size to windowSize
   			 [K(ilo)|M(ega)] may be used as suffixes
   -P <numberOfStreams>	 number of paralel streams(sockets) to use
   			 Default is 4
   -limit <rate>	 Restrict the transfer speed at the specified rate
   			 [K(ilo)|M(ega)] may be used. If no suffix is specified
   			 Bytes/s is considered to be the default.
   -N			 disable Nagle's algorithm
   -monID <monID>	 report session specific params with this monID
   -gsissh		 uses GSI over SSH authentication. It is presumed that
   			 the remote SSHD server supports GSI authentication
   -sshp <remoteSSHPort> the (GSI) SSH port to connect to on the remote host.
   			 This option is used only for SCP_SYNTAX for normal SSH
   			 and GSI over SSH.
   			 By default, the standard SSH port (22) will be used.
   -sshKey <sshKey>	 Will try to use the ssh key specified by <sshKey>
   			 By default, FDT will look for ssh keys in
   			 $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.fdt (DSA) and
   			 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.fdt (RSA)

Server specific:
   -S			 disable standalone mode; if specified, the server
   			 will stop after the last client finishes
   -bs <bufferSize>	 Size for the I/O buffers. [K(ilo)|M(ega)] may be used
   			 as suffixes. The default is 1 MByte.
   -f <allowedIPsList>	 A list of IP addresses allowed to connect to the server
   			 Multiple IP addresses may be separated by ':'

Client/Server:
   -nettest		 Network test mode. The source and destination (-d)
   			 options can be omitted. If present, will be ignored! 
   			 FDT will act only as a network benchmark tool.
   			 If the server is started with this flag *ALL* network
   			 transfers will be considered benchmark transfers!
   -nolock		 Disables file locking on the writer side. Default this
			 flag is false, which means that FDT tries to aquire
			 an exclusive file lock for the file which is written.
   -notmp		 Disables intermediate hidden file creation. Without 
   			 this flag FDT transfers a /localDir/fileName to an 
			 intermediate hidden file /destinationDir/.fileName 
			 and, after the content of the file is transfered,
			 it moves the file to /destinationDir/fileName. 
   -gsi			 Enables the GSI authentication scheme. It must be used
   			 for both the FDT client and server.If the flag is
   			 enabled, the FDT server will accept only GSI
   			 authenticated FDT clients.
   -p <portNumber>	 port number to listen on/connect to (server/client)
   			 or to connect to for the client.Default is 54321.
   -gsip <GSICtrlPort>	 the GSI control port to listen on/connect to
   			 (server/client) for GSI authentication. In the GSI
   			 mode FDT will use two ports: one for control(-gsip)
   			 and one for the data channels(-p). Default value for
   			 GSICtrlPort is 54320.
   -preFilters f1,..,fn	 User defined pre-processing filters. The
   			 preProcessing filters must be in the classpath and
   			 may be cascadated. f1,...,fn are java classes, which
   			 will be loaded in the preProcessing phase.They must be
   			 specified in the FDT "sender" command line.
   -postFilters f1,..,fn User defined post-processing filters. The
   			 postProcessing filters must be in the classpath and
   			 may be cascadated. f1,...,fn are java classes, which
   			 will be loaded in the postProcessing phase. They must
   			 be specified in the FDT "receiver" command line.
   -wCount <wCount>	 number of writer threads per partition.
   			 Default wCount=1.
   -rCount <rCount>	 number of reader threads per partition.
   			 Default rCount=1.
   -md5			 enables MD5 checksum for every file transfered.
   			 It must be specified in the "sender" and the
   			 "receiver" will print am `md5sum`-like list at the end
   			 of the transfer. Default is the checksum is disabled.
   -(n)bio		 (Non-)Blocking I/O mode. In the blocking mode every
   			 stream(socket) will use a thread to perform the I/O.
   			 By default (since 0.9.20) blocking mode is used
   -iof <iof>		 Non blocking I/O retry factor. Repeat every
   			 read/write operation (non-blocking I/O mode only),
   			 which returns 0, up to <iof> times before waiting for
   			 I/O readiness.Default is 1, which should be ok, but 
   			 values of 2 or 3 may show slight gains in network I/O
   			 performance. Usual values are between 1 and 4.
   			 Higher values are not recommended because the gain
   			 will be zero while the CPU System will increase
   -printStats		 Print statistics for buffer pools, sessions, etc
   -v			 Verbose mode. Multiple 'v'-s may be used to increase
   			 the verbosity level. Maximum level is 3 (-vvv), which
   			 corresponds to Level.FINEST for the standard Java
   			 logging system used by FDT.

Miscellaneous:
   -noupdates		 Do not check for updates.
   -silent		 Do not ask for confirmation if updates are available.
   -u, -update,--update	 Update the fdt.jar, if a newer version
   			 is available on the update server and exits
   -V, -version,	 print version information and quit
   --version
   -h, -help, --help	 print this help message and quit
